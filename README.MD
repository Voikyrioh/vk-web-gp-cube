# Voiky's WebGPCube

## Description

This project serves me as a learning sandbox for understanding and experimenting with WebGPU. 
As an exercise in self-learning, my aim is to take on the challenge of creating a game engine based on it. 
The ultimate goal is to develop a voxel 3D game similar to Minecraft, which allows me to experiment with various shading techniques and dive deeper into the world of graphics programming.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Node.js and npm
* You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine

## Installing WebGPCube

To install WebGPU Demonstration:

1. Open your terminal
2. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
3. Navigate into the project directory: `cd [project_directory]`
4. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`

## Using WebGPCube

To use WebGPU Demonstration:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:[port]`.

Please replace `[port]` with the actual port number on which the project will be served.

## Contributing to WebGPCube
I don't accept contributions to this project since the goal is to self-form myself on it. Still, I accept any tips for improving any part of my code which I'm sure is really not optimised and overcomplicated.

## Forking and Licence stuff
Being a bit parano√Ød from some stories of scrapping bots and all those malevolent people and non-people that steal random people work, I put the project on BSD3 License. 

But I'm open to give you rights if for any weird reason you want to fork my project to build yours or add some changes and do your thing on top of it, you can contact me for my approval (That I'll give in the condition that it is not to simply steal and appropriate my work as is for some social media views/like or worse selling it as is).
